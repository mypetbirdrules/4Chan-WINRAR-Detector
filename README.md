# 4Chan-Dubs-Trips-Quads-Detector
The script parses a 4chan thread and finds people with dubs, trips, or quads. Arguably useful.

Install the needed dependencies:

>sudo pip install basc_py4chan

>sudo pip install wget

The script is designed to run in Python 3 but it may run in Python 2 [Not Recommended].

The script requires certain flags to be used regardless or the script will fail.
Here they are:

>--board

>--thread
